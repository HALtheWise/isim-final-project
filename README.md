# iSIM Final Project

Every year, the Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (iSIM) class at Olin 
asks students to design and create a final project that is an analog measurement device, then present their results 
to the instructors and class. We chose to measure position and orientation through precise timing of multiple ultrasonic pulses.

This repository contains the MATLAB code we created to inspect and compute with the data collected in realtime.
